#(Unofficial) Dinosaur Comics message style for Adium

This is an [Adium][1] message style based off of the awesome [Dinosaur Comics][2] by Ryan North.  It was originally posted on [doormouse.org][3] in 2007 but has since not been updated.  I've found a few things I think could be quick fixes so I intended to continue the work here.
